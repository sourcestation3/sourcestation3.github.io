SourceStation3 was created to catalog information about the Valve titles released on PlayStation 3. For years, small groups would pop up, make a few breakthroughs, and then would disappear without sharing how the sausage was made. I have spent a significant amount of time perusing various blogs, Discords, and other resources to gather as much information as possible about the PS3 ports.

This website is designed to stay online with ZERO maintenance. No matter how long I'm gone, this website will remain for as long as GitHub Pages exists. Moreover, if GitHub decides to stop hosting Pages for whatever reason, this website is preserved on [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20250000000000*/https://sourcestation3.github.io/)
